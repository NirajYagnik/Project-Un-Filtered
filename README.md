# Project-UnFiltered
Given the increasing adoption of media-focused social media platforms, we seek to examine the key drivers of authenticity from a human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective.

We conducted this research-based project as a part of our course on Anti-Social Computing (CSE 291) under the guidance of Dr. Kristen Vaccaro.

## Motivation:
From previous studies, we have found that expectation for authentic performance might increase pressure on users. Online authenticity is considered highly subjective and seen as a social construct. Understanding the perspective of authenticity desired by a diverse set of population and descending into an era where it is perceived as paramount in the social world is crucial. We focuses on the photo and video-based memories sharing sites BeReal, Snapchat, and Instagram. BeReal enables users to capture a photo using their front and rear camera to depict their lives without filters, likes, and other social pressures on Instagram and Snapchat. With no prior literature focusing on the impact of the application, our study tries to understand how users perceive authenticity on BeReal compared to Instagram and Snapchat. While one aspect of our study shall focus on understanding factors which drive authenticity, we also try to understand what drives engagement on a platform. We intend to conceptualize all the best practices of social media platforms to find what promotes the highest authenticity.


## Methodology:
We divide the study into distinct and significant components. We took the approach of conducting interviews and design workshops to best answer our questions. We equip qualitative analysis to form our deductions and propose the ideal features to allow users to enhance authenticity online. The two distinct components are: 
1. **Feature-Centric interviews**: We aim to employ feature-centric questions to get answers to two Research Questions:
* **RQ1**: Do users feel the burden of maintaining a specific image or persona on social media? \
* **RQ2**: What features on social media platforms influence authenticity? \
* **RQ3**: What changes to these features might increase the amenability sense of authenticity?

2. **Asynchronous Design Workshop**: For the next part of our study, we conduct asynchronous design thinking workshops to allow the participants to propose a new platform that includes/enhances the best existing features of these platforms.
